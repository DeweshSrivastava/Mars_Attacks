# MARS ATTACKS

## The Requirement

Earthings! The Martians are here!  The folks at `UFO's are Coming` have collected all of the eye-witness reports to prove it! Now we deliver this information for the world to see.

But it is alot of material. We need to have an convenient way to sort through the material.

We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide]./static/js/data.js. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though.  We use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web pages. They are the coding languages which prove to be validated.


## The Task

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Basic HTML web page or use the [index.html]./index.html file provided (thus build custom page).

* Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, script code that appends that table to a new web page and then add new rows of data for each sighting.

  * Make sure to have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Give a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match the user's input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the any user can to set multiple filters and search for Alien sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
